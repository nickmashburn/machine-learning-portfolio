My public ML portfolio.

Portfolio:

keras-cifar10.py <machine-learning-portfolio/keras-cifar10.py> - this is a convolutional neural network built using Keras with a Theano backend (can be easily modified to use TensorFlow as a backend. Code has not been updated to be compatible with CNTK backend or Keras 2.0.
